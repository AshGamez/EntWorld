#NOTICE: We now have an offical area to notify eveyone of server issues! Please join to keep updated. https://www.curse.com/deadpine

Entworld V5
=============
This is a subserver for [Deadpine](http://www.twitch.tv/deadpine), and thus you have to be a twitch subscriber to get whitelisted.
[Look, fancy modlist!](/modlist.md)

Welcome to Ent World! We hope you enjoy the server while you are with us! We will always use the [Ent World](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/ent-world) pack on curse when we are not using a pack made by someone else.

First, Link Twitch and your Minecraft accounts!
---------------------

You only need to link Twitch. You do not need GameWisp or Beam for this server.

**[You need to link your accounts (Twitch & Minecraft) in order to be able to play on the server by clicking here.](http://www.doubledoordev.net/?p=linking)**

Second, Read the rules!
---------

- We have logging information and a strict policy.
- We reserve the right to refuse access to anyone.
- There is no uptime guarantee.
- The lifetime of the server is never known.
- The server must be stable. We will remove ANYTHING to keep things working if needed.

1. Don't be a dick.
2. Don't be a dick. Share land and work together.
3. Don't be a dick. This includes not poking around in other people's stuff.
4. Don't be a dick. You cannot claim resources. Collect it and Store it.
5. ALL automatic farms of any type must have a way to be turned off. Turn them off when you do not need them anymore.
6. Mark your buildings with a sign with your name and whoever lives there/made it. If you abandon something mark it abandon!
7. Clean up after your adventures! Don't leave behind pilars of junk. Make waypoint bases instead.
8. Asking questions is OK but we are not Wikipedia. If you would like to learn a whole mod click its name in curse and click "Website" in the top right.
9. Link nether portals properly please. Use this site to help you [http://www.mavenspun.com/games/minecraft/](http://www.mavenspun.com/games/minecraft/) 
10. Bulding portals in other dimentions other than the overworld can put you outside the border. YOU WILL DIE! 

Things You Need to know!
------------------------

1. The server is on a reboot timer to help reduce lag. Once a day there should be a 15 minute warning before the restart and the restart should only take a few minutes to complete.
2. If the server is down please contact someone below. If you have any other issues use the [issue tracker!](https://github.com/Claycorp/EntWorld/issues).

Setting up the Pack!
--------

The current pack is [PineFresh](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/pinefresh-1-9?gameCategorySlug=modpacks&projectID=238846)!
Please follow the instructions below for how to get the pack! If you have not done 'Getting on the Server' you must do that before trying to connect! Otherwise you CAN NOT JOIN!


Windows/Mac users: 
- Download & install [CurseVoice beta](http://beta.cursevoice.com/).
- Go to the "Plugins" tab, enable Minecraft
- Go to the "Minecraft" tab
- Search & install for "PineFresh"
- **If you have the pack installed already, make sure it is up to date!**

Linux users:
- USE MULTIMC
- Make a new instance, using 'Import modpack' with this link: http://dl.dries007.net/PineFresh_V2.7.1.zip

Please don't abuse this link. It will be removed if it gets used for anything unintened.

(If a new version of the pack comes out and this link is not yet updated, ask Dries007)

Ent World updates and voting
--------
In Ent World V5 we are trying something new. Instead of letting the server sit for weeks/months with no updates or changes we are going to ask the people playing the server to give input for next weeks update!

How this works is quite simple!
 1. Check [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FNnXL8Z0wM3qB5xblRzEtO1PN8vMgHnnvsa1oa3FAX4/edit?usp=sharing) for the current ideas.
 2. Fill out [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/JwHKQw6gP3A3AH5g1) if you don't see your idea.
 3. Wait till the end of the week for us to collect the results.
 4. Then the next week vote for the changes you want on the poll. The polls will be on the curse server in the Ent World room!
 5. Those changes will be added and pushed to the server at the end of the week.

Ideas for changes will always be for the week AFTER they are subbmited. Example: You suggest we add mod X on week 1. This will be put in the poll on week 2. You then suggest on week 2 that mod X should get addon mod Y. Mod Y will show up on week 3's poll not week 2.

- If nobody suggests anything and the majority of mods do not need to be updated there will be no update for that week.
- When a poll is finished a change will need AT LEAST 50% of active users votes for "Yes" or "Don't Care".
- Server Admins hold every right to deny any addition or revert any change voted on by the community.
