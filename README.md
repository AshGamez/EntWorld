Things You Need to know!
------------------------

1. The server is on a reboot timer to help reduce lag. Once a day there should be a 15 minute warning before the restart and the restart should only take a few minutes to complete.
2. If the server is down please contact someone below. If you have any other issues use the [issue tracker!](https://github.com/Claycorp/EntWorld/issues).

Rules! You better follow them!
---------

1. Deadpine is our supreme leader, and his disciples' decisions are LAW.
2. Don't be a dick.
3. Don't be a dick. This includes not poking around in other people's stuff.
4. Don't be a dick. You cannot claim resources. Collect it and Store it.
5. Don't be a dick. Share land and work together.
6. Mark your buildings with a sign with your name and whoever lives there/made it. If you abandon something mark it abandon!
7. Clean up after your adventures! Don't leave behind pilars of junk. Make waypoint bases instead.
8. Asking questions is OK but we are not Wikipedia. If you would like to learn a whole mod click its name in curse and click "Website" in the top right.

- We have logging information and a strict policy.
- We reserve the right to refuse access to anyone.
- There is no uptime guarantee.
- The lifetime of the server is never known.
- The server must be stable. We will remove peoples stuff or mods to keep things working if needed.
